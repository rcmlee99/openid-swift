## Overview

This is a sample OpenID Connect App using IOS Swift Code.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol, based on the OAuth 2.0 family of specifications. It uses simple JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which you can obtain using flows conforming to the OAuth 2.0 specifications.

While OAuth 2.0 is about resource access and sharing, OIDC is all about user authentication. Its purpose is to give you one login for multiple sites. Each time you need to log in to a website using OIDC, you are redirected to your OpenID site where you login, and then taken back to the website.
